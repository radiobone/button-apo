# **App Name**: Color Splash

## Core Features:

- Color Buttons: Four buttons (A, B, C, D) in the corners of the screen, each with a distinct color (red, green, yellow, blue respectively).
- Full-Screen Color Display: When a button is tapped, the entire screen fills with the button's color, and the corresponding letter is displayed in a large font size.
- Back Button: A small 'Back' button at the bottom of the screen allows users to return to the main screen.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vivid and saturated purple (#9C27B0) that symbolizes creativity and imagination, appropriate for a color-focused app.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated purple (#F3E5F5) for a soft and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting blue-violet (#3F51B5) that provides visual interest and balances the composition.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines to provide a clear, simple presentation.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- The four color buttons should be placed in the corners of the screen with equal spacing. The 'Back' button should be centered at the bottom with adequate padding.
- Use a smooth transition animation when switching between the color display and the main screen.
